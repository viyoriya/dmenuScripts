dmenu / nvim 
============

simple dmenu scripts

1. dfm    - basic filemanager to open the file.
2. dmount - un mount the drive from /mnt and list the drive(s) to mount in /mnt
3. dpass  - lists stored password from password-store (using pass)
4. dtodo  - add/delete todo/task list

provide execute permission and add all this files in /usr/local/bin/ so you can quickly access from dmenu.

5. dmenu.vim -  its not a plugin so just copy and paste the code in init.vim file (neovim)

Note 
----
Type 'quit' to quit the dfm  else you may need to use other tty to kill the script so remember the word 'quit' :).
Dont create the folder named 'quit' :)   .
If any issue simple solution to exit just select one random file :)  .
Please add your preferred application(s) in these scripts to open the file(s).
I used feh,tar,unzip,zethura,nvim in these scripts.
